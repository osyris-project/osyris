*********************************
Osyris - Visualization for Ramses
*********************************

Osyris is a python utility to read, manipulate and visualize simulation data
created by the astrophysical software
`Ramses <https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses>`_.
Osyris provides automatic handling of physical units,
loading of sub-regions inside a large simulation,
and enables the production of publication grade figures.

It was designed to be portable, lightweight and fast,
requiring minimum dependencies and resources.
It currently only works with the native ``binary`` Ramses data output format.
Osyris stores the data internally as one-dimensional arrays, and can also be used to
visualize outputs from other simulation codes, such as e.g.
`Dispatch <https://dispatch.readthedocs.io>`_.
It uses `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_ for data
manipulation, `Pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_ for physical units,
and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/>`_ for visualization.
